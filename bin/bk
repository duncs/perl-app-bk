=head1 NAME

bk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  bk [-?hV]
  bk [filename] [...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Command to ease backing up a file before editting.  If a previously backed
up file exists and has a matching checksum a new backup is not made.  Backed up
files have date/time appended as necessary.

When invoked as root the username is not appended to the backup file name.

Backups are stored relative to file being backed up.
